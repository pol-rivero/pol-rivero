**Today's tech haiku:**
```
Chip titans align
Five billion bets on cores
Foundry dreams respark

## Some o' me projects:

- **[doot](https://github.com/pol-rivero/doot):** Turns out that all existin' dotfile managers suck, and writin' me own be th' only way t' go.  It's designed t' be intuitive and *extremely* fast, while also supportin' advanced features such as private (encrypted) files, host-specific alternative files and bootstrappin' repositories, I'll warrant ye.
 
- **[GitHub Desktop Plus](https://github.com/pol-rivero/github-desktop-plus):** A fork o' GitHub Desktop that adds some features I needed fer me workflow.  It includes commit search, Bitbucket support, branch name preset generation, and [many small features and improvements](https://github.com/pol-rivero/github-desktop-plus?tab=readme-ov-file#extra-features), ye scurvey dog.  Additionally, upstream changes be merged much more frequently than in th' shiftkey fork.
 
- **[Discord Audio Stream](https://github.com/pol-rivero/DiscordAudioStream):** It's very easy t' share yer screen usin' Discord.  Bein' able t' hear it, not so much, pass the grog!  Shiver me timbers! This tool gives ye control o'er th' audio that ye send t' Discord, makin' it possible t' share a screen with audio, use OBS, and any other use case ye can think o'.
 
- **CESC16:** A custom CPU, designed from scratch and built on PCBs.  Completely 16-bit, with support fer interrupts and improved General Purpose IO (GPIO) ports.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/pol-rivero/CESC16) with documentation, schematics and some tools.   
  - [Emulator](https://github.com/pol-rivero/CESC16-emulator) written in C++, usin' th' ncurses library, and a bottle of rum!   
  - [ANSI C compiler](https://github.com/pol-rivero/lcc), by implementin' a backend fer th' lcc retargetable compiler.   

- **CESC:** Previous CPU architecture, inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 and built on breadboards.  It's an 8-bit architecture with a very simple instruction set.   
  - [Main repository](https://github.com/pol-rivero/CESCA) with documentation, images and some tools.
 
- **[Arduino VGA Terminal](https://github.com/pol-rivero/ArduinoVGA):** Use an Arduino Nano t' sail a VGA monitor, pass the grog, pass the grog! It only supports text output, so 'tis great as a terminal fer yer homebrew CPU projects.
